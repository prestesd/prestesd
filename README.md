<h2>Hello! I'm Dani!</h2>

<p> I'm a chemistry teacher and a beginner in the world of programming. </p>
<p> I'm very happy I've got into the technology world. I'm focused on studying Systems for Internet, which is also the name of the course I'm studying at <a href="http://www.poa.ifrs.edu.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&layout=edit&id=3206">IFRS.</a> I'm at my first semester!</p>
<p> Nowadays I'm learning about <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b> PHP</b>. And other stuff, of course! :D </p>
