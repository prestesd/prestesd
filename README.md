## Hello! I'm Dani!

I'm a chemistry teacher and a beginner in the world of programming.  
I'm very happy I've got into the technology world. I'm focused on studying Systems for Internet, which is also the name of the course I'm studying at [IFRS](http://www.poa.ifrs.edu.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&layout=edit&id=3206). I'm at my first semester!  
I'm currently working with Angular and Ionic.
